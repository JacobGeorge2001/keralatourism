The church, popularly known as Edappally Pally, was a small structure at the time of its construction in 594 AD. In 1080 AD, a bigger church was built adjacent to the old one to accommodate the congregation that had grown greatly in number. The Edappally pilgrim church was the richest Catholic shrine in Kerala. Due to the uncountable miracles of Edappally St George, the Catholic Church were deciding to elevate this miraculous Church to the status of a National Shrine Basilica.100000+ holy masses were conducted in every year in this holy land.</p>

            <p id="innerpara">Chottanikkara Temple is one among the most famous temples of Kerala where mentally disturbed people, come in thousands to get cured. This temple is 8 KM away from present-day Thripoonithura (which is a suburb of Kochin or Eranakulam).

                There are two main temples here. The first one we see as soon as we enter is the temple of Rajarajeswari. The one behind it in a slightly lower elevation is called Keezhekavu, which has Bhadra Kali consecrated there. The Rajarajeswari is worshipped as Goddess Saraswathi in the morning, as Bhadra kali at noon and Durga in the night. This temple opens its doors every day at 4 AM. People believe that Goddess Mookambika of Kollur attends the first worship here before going to her temple. Another peculiarity of this temple is that the Goddess is not fixed to the ground but rests on a bed of sand. Nearby her, is the idol of Lord Vishnu. Hence the devotees always pray to her along with her brother Lord Narayana and chant 'Amme Narayana'.

            <p id="innerpara">The history of Kadamattom Church goes back as far as the 9th century. The prominent family around that era was the ‘Kartha’ family. When one of the children in the family fell ill, the local doctors were incapable of identifying the ailment or cure for the child. Mar Sabor, an East Syrian monk, was visiting the area, and cured the child. Out of gratitude, the Kartha family gifted the monk with a land, where he built Kadamattom Church, one of the oldest churches of the country.

            <p id="innerpara">The town is situated in highland regions, and has a lot of fertile soil deposited by the floods that used to occur in the region. There is a beautiful river nearby, whose banks have a diverse species of flora and fauna. In addition to this, the church itself is surrounded by a lot of greenery, maintained by the authorities
